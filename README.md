## 🌟 About Me

I’m a **data science student** passionate about the intersection of **artificial intelligence, software engineering, and human-centered data systems**.  
I love building tools that make complex ideas more intuitive — from election forecasting and database architecture to quantum computing outreach.

When I’m not coding, I’m either rowing on the CWRU team, speaking Spanish, or cooking something new from scratch.
